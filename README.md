# Social Engineering Attacks Report

*Author:* Mahak Rana   
*Objective:* To explain common types of social engineering attacks, real-world examples, and ways to protect individuals and organizations.

## 1. Introduction

Social engineering attacks are *psychological manipulation techniques* that trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.  
Unlike technical hacks, these attacks exploit *human trust, curiosity, or fear*.

This report covers *three major types* of social engineering attacks:
1. *Phishing*
2. *Pretexting*
3. *Baiting*

## 2. Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 2.1 Phishing

*🔹 What it is*  
Phishing is when attackers send fraudulent messages (often emails) pretending to be from a trusted source, to steal login credentials, financial details, or other sensitive data.

*🔹 How it works*  
- Victim receives an email or message claiming to be from a bank, government agency, or company.  
- The message contains a *malicious link* or *attachment*.  
- Clicking it either downloads malware or leads to a fake website where the victim enters personal information.

*🔹 Real example*  
In 2020, *Twitter* suffered a massive breach when attackers *phished employees* via phone calls, gaining access to internal tools and hijacking high-profile accounts.

*🔹 How to prevent it*  
- Use *email filtering* and spam detection.  
- Train employees to verify sender addresses.  
- Enable *multi-factor authentication (MFA)*.  
- Never click suspicious links without verification.

### 2.2 Pretexting

*🔹 What it is*  
Pretexting involves creating a believable but false story (a “pretext”) to convince a victim to share information or perform actions.

*🔹 How it works*  
- Attacker pretends to be someone with authority (IT staff, HR, law enforcement).  
- Builds trust by using background information (often from social media).  
- Asks for confidential details like passwords, account numbers, or access codes.

*🔹 Real example*  
In 2016, a *pretexting scam* targeted Snapchat. An attacker impersonated the CEO and convinced an HR employee to send payroll data of current and former employees.

*🔹 How to prevent it*  
- Verify identities before sharing sensitive data.  
- Have *strict policies* for data requests.  
- Educate staff on social engineering tactics.

### 2.3 Baiting

*🔹 What it is*  
Baiting uses the promise of something appealing to lure victims into a trap, often involving malware.

*🔹 How it works*  
- Attacker leaves an infected USB drive labeled “Confidential” in a public place.  
- Curious victim plugs it into a computer.  
- Malware is installed, giving the attacker access to the system.

*🔹 Real example*  
A study by Google found that *48% of people* who found USB drives in public plugged them into their computers — showing how effective baiting can be.

*🔹 How to prevent it*  
- Educate users not to plug unknown devices into computers.  
- Disable autorun features for removable media.  
- Use endpoint protection software.

## 3. Case Study: The RSA Breach (2011)

- Attackers sent *phishing emails* with the subject “2011 Recruitment Plan” to small groups of RSA employees.  
- The email had an Excel file containing a *zero-day exploit* that installed a backdoor.  
- This led to the theft of sensitive data related to RSA’s SecurID authentication products.  
- The breach affected multiple defense contractors and cost millions to recover from.

## 4. Recommendations

To reduce the risk of social engineering attacks:

1. *Employee Training*  
   - Conduct regular awareness programs.  
   - Simulate phishing attacks to test responses.  

   2. **Verification Procedures**  
   - Always confirm identity before sharing data.  
   - Use internal communication channels for sensitive requests.  

3. **Technical Measures**  
   - Enable MFA on all accounts.  
   - Use email filtering and anti-malware tools.  
   - Restrict use of external USB devices.

4. **Incident Response**  
   - Report suspicious activity immediately.  
   - Have a documented response plan for potential breaches.

---
## 5. Conclusion

Social engineering is one of the **most effective cyberattack methods** because it targets human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities.  
Combining **employee awareness**, **strict policies**, and **technical defenses** is the best way to protect against phishing, pretexting, and baiting.
